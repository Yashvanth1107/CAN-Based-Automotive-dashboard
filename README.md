CAN-Based Car Dashboard System (3-ECU Communication using CAN Protocol)
This project simulates a car dashboard system using the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol with three ECUs (Electronic Control Units) — similar to how real automotive systems communicate internally.
Each ECU performs a dedicated role to collectively represent a functional vehicle dashboard.

🧩 Project Overview
ECU	Function	Description
ECU1	Speed & Gear ECU	Reads vehicle speed and gear position and transmits over CAN bus.
ECU2	RPM & Indicator ECU	Reads engine RPM and indicator status (Left, Right, Hazard, Off).
ECU3	Dashboard ECU	Receives CAN messages and displays Speed, Gear, RPM, and Indicators on CLCD.
⚙️ Key Features
Multi-ECU communication using CAN Bus Protocol
Real-time display of Speed, Gear, RPM, and Indicator Status
Collision alert when gear is set to collision gear (Gr)
Indicator control with blinking arrows (<, >)
Modular design for each ECU
Built using PIC18F4580, MPLAB X IDE, and XC8 Compiler
🛠️ Hardware & Software Details
Component	Description
Microcontroller	PIC18F4580 (with inbuilt CAN module)
Compiler	MPLAB XC8
IDE	MPLAB X
Display	16x2 Character LCD (CLCD)
Communication Protocol	CAN Bus
Input Devices	Matrix Keypad (for gear and indicator control)
⚡ CAN Message Mapping
Message ID	Sent From	Description	Data Length
SPEED_MSG_ID	ECU1	Vehicle speed (km/h)	3 bytes
GEAR_MSG_ID	ECU1	Gear position (1–8)	1 byte
RPM_MSG_ID	ECU2	Engine RPM	5 bytes
INDICATOR_MSG_ID	ECU2	Indicator status (left/right/hazard/off)	1 byte
⚠️ Collision Alert Logic
When the gear position is set to 8 (Gr), the system detects a potential collision.

The dashboard (ECU3) clears the display and shows:

Normal dashboard updates are paused during this state.

Once the gear is changed back to any normal position, the dashboard display is restored automatically.

🚦 System Behavior Summary
Condition	ECU	Behavior
Gear Up / Down	ECU1	Sends updated gear and speed values over CAN
Collision Gear (Gr)	ECU1 → ECU3	Displays collision alert and stops normal updates
Indicator Left / Right / Hazard	ECU2 → ECU3	Updates corresponding indicator symbols on CLCD
Speed / RPM	ECU1 & ECU2 → ECU3	Continuously updated and displayed in real-time
